 Basic firewall management skills and understanding of network traffic filtering

Opened the firewall configuration tool:

Windows: Used Windows Firewall with Advanced Security

Linux: Used UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) via terminal

Listed current firewall rules to review existing configurations.

Added a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet).

Tested the rule by attempting to connect to port 23 locally and remotely to ensure it was effectively blocked.

Added a rule to allow SSH (port 22) to maintain secure remote access on Linux.

Removed the test rule for Telnet to restore the firewall to its original state.

Documented all steps using relevant terminal commands or GUI paths.

Understood and demonstrated that firewalls filter network traffic by allowing or denying packets based on defined rules like port number, protocol, and traffic direction.
